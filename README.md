There is actually no code here, but soon. And how the direction will be you can already see, cause...

**CannaBreezy** has two usable siblings...
- <a href="https://github.com/PitWD/QuickTimer"> CannaClocky</a> to get any timings, to grow plants, done. As you can read in another repository from me: <a href="https://github.com/CannaParts/LetsGrowSmart/blob/main/FastVegaFlowerLowPower.md">To grow Cannabis based on 24h cycles is wasted time and energy.</a> To do such timings - you will need CannaClocky.

- <a href="https://github.com/PitWD/QuickWater"> CannaWatery</a> to measure and regulate pH, EC, Â°C, Redox, O2 and level of your water. *All water specific sensors/modules from <a href="https://atlas-scientific.com/"> Atlas-Scientific</a> are supported.*
